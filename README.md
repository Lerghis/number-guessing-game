# Number Guessing Game (Java)
A console-based interactive number guessing game built in Java. This project demonstrates real application program structure, clean input handling, and exception management.

---

## **Features**

- Three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**
- Limited attempts per difficulty: Easy (10), Medium (5), Hard (3)
- Optional hints: **Parity**, **Range**, **Digit Sum**
- Strong hint logic based on difficulty level and remaining hints
- High score tracking per difficulty
- Game timer and replay system
- Exception handling for invalid input

---

## **Program Structure**

The program follows a **professional, layered method structure**, where each method has a clear responsibility:

main() â†’ Menu() â†’ playGame() â†’ processTurn() â†’ generateHint() â†’ specificHintMethods()


- `main()` â†’ starts the program and calls the `Menu`
- `Menu()` â†’ handles difficulty selection and game loop
- `playGame()` â†’ manages a single round, attempts, timer, high scores
- `processTurn()` â†’ processes each user input (guess or hint)
- `generateHint()` â†’ selects the next hint based on history, difficulty, and remaining hints
- `parityHint()`, `rangeHint()`, `digitSumHint()` â†’ specific hint generators

This separation ensures **clean, maintainable, and scalable code**.

## **Input Handling & Exception Logic**

- All user input is read using `keyboard.nextLine()` to read full lines.
- Inputs are **manually parsed** using `Integer.parseInt()` when needed.
- Invalid input triggers **try/catch blocks** without crashing the program.
- Examples of handled invalid inputs: `" 45abc"`, `"hintt"`, `" "`, `"five"`.

This ensures the program **never leaves leftover tokens in the input buffer**, preventing crashes in subsequent menus or turns.

---

## **Strong Hint System**

- Hints are categorized as **regular** (`parity`) and **strong** (`range`, `digitSum`).
- Conditions for strong hints:
    - Few hints remaining for Easy and Medium
    - Always strong for Hard difficulty
- The `generateHint` method automatically selects the correct hint type and ensures no repeated hints are given.

## **How to Run**

1. Compile the project:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

2. Run the program:

```bash
java Main
```

3. Follow on-screen prompts to select difficulty and guess the number.
4. Use "hint" to request hints (limited based on difficulty).

## **Future Enhancements**

- Track cumulative time-based scoring 
- Save and load high scores to a file 
- Add a GUI using Swing or JavaFX 
- Color-coded console feedback 
- Unit tests for individual methods
